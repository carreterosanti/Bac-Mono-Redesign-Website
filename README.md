### Idea Begind

The objective of this project was to experience some practice developing React.

Start by making the navigation bar more simple and expanded, and then trying to avoid the classic carrousel of photos present in all the web sites of car brands, but respecting the information presented in the original version of the web site.

Therefore, it was decided to integrate the options displayed by certain elements of the navigation bar in the sidebar of the main page.
